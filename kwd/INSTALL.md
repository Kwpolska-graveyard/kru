1. Edit the template file. Put it the way you want it. You have to put ALL of the variables, including T_NOTES. Put it like this:

    PURPOSE:
    _KWDPURPOSE_
     
    INSTALL:
    _KWDINSTRUCTIONS_
    _KWDNOTES_
    
    COPYRIGHT:
    _KWDCOPYRIGHT_

it puts just nothing in the line. but it must be in file.
2. Edit the gplv3 file - put your data in the copyright.
3. Run ./configure
4. If you have problems, open an issue in the tracker at <http://github.com/Kwpolska/kru/issues>.
