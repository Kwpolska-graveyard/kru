1. Edit the template file. Put it the way you want it. You have to put ALL of the variables, including notes. Put it like this:

1 PURPOSE:
2 T_PURPOSE
3 
4 INSTALL:
5 T_INSTRUCTIONS
6 T_NOTES
...

it puts just nothing in the line. but it must be in file.
2. Edit the gplv3 file - put your data in the copyright.
3. Run ./createdir - it will prepare the script for working.
4. Edit the kwd perl script. You NEED to change the path to kwd directory. You shall edit the notes template or do other stuff for doing it your way.
5. Check if it works. If not, fix your files.
6. If you have problems all the way, put an issue in the tracker at http://github.com/Kwpolska/kru/issues
