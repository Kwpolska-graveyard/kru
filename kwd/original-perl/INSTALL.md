NOTICE: This readme applies for KWDv1.

1. Edit the template file. Put it the way you want it. You have to put ALL of the variables, including `_KWDNOTES_`. Put it like this:

    PURPOSE:
    _KWDPURPOSE_
    
    INSTALL:
    _KWDINSTRUCTIONS_
    _KWDNOTES_
    
    COPYRIGHT:
    _KWDCOPYRIGHT_

If notes and usage aren't set, `_KWDNOTES` puts nothing in the line, but it must be in the file.
2. Run ./configure.py.
3. If you will have to add a license, use addlic.py (syntax: ./addlic.py OR ./addlic.py [--nodata] FILE)
